# Config Command Matrix

This document compares Mango, current River, and Triad by user-facing
configuration surface. The main table groups commands by functionality so name
differences are visible. `X` means Triad has a user-facing config key, binding
command, IPC request, or implemented behavior for that feature.

Current River is non-monolithic. It supplies compositor configuration,
startup, and protocol primitives, while window-management policy belongs to the
external window manager.

## Config Work Status

The Niri and Mango config review workstreams are complete. Remaining gaps are
protocol-dependent or tracked in the feature matrix below.

| Priority | Workstream | Target Triad surface | Niri/Mango reference | Current status | First milestone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Done | Config lifecycle | `include`, `include optional=true`, custom config path, `triad validate-config` | Niri `include` and `validate`; Mango `source`, `source-optional`, `mango -c`, `mango -c ... -p` | Implemented with in-place include expansion, recursion safety, include hot reload watching, `TRIAD_CONFIG`, `--config`, `-c`, standalone validation, strict field validation inside known blocks, strict output-rule validation, strict window-rule regex checks, and configured Janet script/layout validation. | Keep validating against real configs while future config work expands. |
| Done | Input device config | `input { keyboard; mouse; touchpad; trackpoint; trackball }` | Niri `input`; Mango keyboard, mouse, and trackpad settings | Implemented through River input, XKB, and libinput config protocols for keyboard repeat, XKB keymaps/options, lock state, and basic mouse/touchpad/trackpoint/trackball settings. | Keep validating against live hardware; keyboard layout cycling remains separate command work. |
| Done | Output rules | `output { layout ...; monitor "name" { focus-at-startup; workspaces ...; mode; scale; position; transform; adaptive-sync; vrr; enabled; disabled; reserved_area }; default { ... } }` | Niri `output`; Mango/Hyprland `monitorrule` | Implemented for grouped and legacy output rules, physical matrix layout, startup focus, pinned workspace/output affinity, effective default workspaces that cover connected monitors, automatic reserved workspace distribution from the startup-focus or primary output by monitor geometry, and wlroots output-management mode/scale/position/transform/adaptive-sync/enablement config, plus additive Triad usable-area reservations. Strict validation rejects unknown, malformed, or River-blocked output fields before startup/reload. | Mirroring, bit depth, color/HDR/ICC fields, and compositor-specific luminance metadata remain future River/protocol features. |
| Done | Session environment | `environment { KEY "value"; KEY #null }` | Niri `environment`; Mango `env` | Implemented for future Triad-spawned user-facing processes; values are literal and `#null` unsets a variable. | Keep documenting that this does not retroactively change external systemd/dbus-launched processes or already-running apps. |
| Done | Binding event types | `switch-events` and gestures | Mango `axisbind`, `gesturebind`, `switchbind`; Niri gestures and switch events | Implemented for key press/release, locked-session keys, pointer buttons, wheel-axis bindings, touchpad swipe gestures, and Linux evdev lid/tablet switch events. | Use evdev switch delivery today; compositor-native switch events remain blocked until River exposes a protocol surface for them. |
| Done | Focused polish | Cursor hiding, config notifications, overview/recent/hotkey overlays, and frame/animation tuning | Niri config notifications, gestures, animations, layer rules; Mango visuals/effects/layer rules | Implemented cursor theme/size/shake/hiding, config reload notification commands, overview controls, recent windows, hotkey overlay layout controls, coarse animation speed, viewport snap-threshold tuning, and configurable output-refresh-aware frame pacing. | Layer-rule polish remains protocol-blocked; do not add layer-rule config until River exposes enough layer-shell identity/state. |

## Feature Matrix

| Area | Functionality | Mango name(s) | River surface | Triad name(s) | Triad | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Config lifecycle | Default config file | `~/.config/mango/config.conf` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/river/init` or `~/.config/river/init` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/triad/config.kdl` | X | Triad creates a fallback config when missing. |
| Config lifecycle | Custom config on launch | `mango -c` | `river -c` shell command | `TRIAD_CONFIG`, `triad --config`, `triad -c` | X | Triad can start from a non-default root config path. |
| Config lifecycle | Config validation | `mango -c ... -p` | | `triad validate-config` | X | Validates KDL syntax, includes, unknown and malformed fields inside known blocks, strict output-rule shapes, unsupported output fields, strict window-rule regex checks, and configured Janet script/layout registration without starting the daemon. |
| IPC | Native state queries | | Shell/WM IPC | `triad msg state`, `capabilities`, `captures`, `workspaces`, `outputs`, `windows`, `focused-window`, `overview-state`, `keyboard-layouts` | X | Returns native Triad shell snapshot projections and feature capabilities, including workspace content-scroll, monitor-power, capture-session, and workspace-urgency support flags, without going through the temporary Niri compatibility bridge. Native event streams support state, layout, window, and capture-session change events. |
| Config lifecycle | Config includes | `source`, `source-optional` | Shell script can source files | `include`, `include optional=#true` | X | Includes expand in place, resolve relative to the parent file, reject recursion, and participate in hot reload after a successful load. |
| Config lifecycle | Hot reload | `reload_config`, `exec` | WM process policy | `config-reload`, `triad-reload` | X | Triad reloads config in-process; full Triad reload snapshots state and restarts through the session manager path. |
| Config lifecycle | Reload notifications | | Shell/WM policy | `config-notification` | X | Optional commands run on config reload success, failure, or rollback. |
| Config lifecycle | Theme accent | | WM policy | `theme { accent-color }` | X | Optional active chrome default for border, frame tab, layout-toast, and recent-window highlight colors. Specific color fields still win. |
| Startup | Startup commands | `exec-once`, `exec` | Init script starts long-running programs | `spawn-at-startup` | X | Triad has startup commands, not a reload-time `exec` equivalent. |
| Startup | Environment variables | `env` | Init script environment | `environment` | X | Applies literal set/unset entries to future Triad-spawned user-facing processes. |
| Startup | Spawn command | `spawn`, `spawn_shell`, `spawn_on_empty` | WM policy | `spawn`, `spawn-terminal` | X | Triad spawn uses argv-style text command parsing. Niri-compatible `Spawn` and `SpawnSh` actions map to the same configured-process spawn path for shell clients. |
| Session | Quit manager | `quit` | `river_window_manager_v1.stop` | `stop-manager` | X | Triad also has `exit-session` behind config. |
| Session | Exit compositor session | `quit` | `river_window_manager_v1.exit_session` | `exit-session`, `allow-exit-session` | X | Guarded by explicit config; default configs bind `Ctrl+Alt+Delete` and require Enter confirmation before exit. Niri `Quit` with `skip_confirmation` bypasses the dialog for shell session menus. |
| Session | Lock screen | External bind to `spawn` | Init/WM policy | `screen-lock`, `lock-session` | X | Triad stores a configured lock command. |
| Bindings | Key bindings | `bind`, `bindl`, `binds`, `bindr`, `bindp` | `river_xkb_bindings_v1` | `bindings { bind ... }` | X | Triad supports mode, layout override, inhibit policy, and hotkey overlay titles. |
| Bindings | Key modes/submaps | `keymode`, `setkeymode` | WM policy | `mode="normal"`, `mode="overview"`, or `mode="recent"` | | Triad has fixed binding modes, not arbitrary named modes. Unified overview and recent-windows add modal fallback bindings, including derived direction-key navigation, only when those key slots are free. |
| Bindings | Recent-window switcher | MRU switcher actions | WM policy plus `river_xkb_bindings_v1` | `recent-windows`, `recent-window-*` | X | Niri-style recent window switching with debounce, open delay, scopes, app-id filter, and preview overlay. Defaults are Alt-only so `Super+Tab` remains available for Triad focus commands. |
| Bindings | HJKL/arrow mirroring | Manual binds | WM policy | `mirror-hjkl-arrows` | X | Triad can generate arrow equivalents for HJKL binds. |
| Bindings | Pass/locked/release flags | `bindp`, `bindl`, `bindr` | Protocol has press/release events | `bind ... on-release=#true`, `while-locked=#true` | X | Triad supports release-triggered and locked-session keyboard binds. Pass-through binds remain unsupported. |
| Bindings | Eat next key | | `ensure_next_key_eaten` | `eat-next-key`, `cancel-eat-next-key` | X | Useful for modal shell interactions. |
| Pointer | Mouse button bindings | `mousebind` | `river_seat_v1.get_pointer_binding` | `bindings { pointer-bind ... }` | X | Triad supports configured move/resize pointer bindings. |
| Pointer | Scroll wheel bindings | `axisbind` | Pointer axis from Wayland, policy in WM | `bindings { axis-bind ... }` | X | Triad supports wheel-up/down/left/right command bindings using raw pointer-axis events. |
| Pointer | Touchpad gestures | `gesturebind` | `zwp_pointer_gestures_v1` swipe events | `bindings { gesture-bind ... }` | X | Triad dispatches configured 3- and 4-finger swipe bindings from live touchpad swipe end events when the compositor advertises pointer gestures. |
| Pointer | Lid/switch bindings | `switchbind` | Input events/protocols | `switch-events` | X | Triad stores lid/tablet switch event commands, has a synthetic dispatcher, and reads Linux evdev `EV_SW` lid/tablet events when readable. Compositor-native switch delivery is not exposed yet. |
| Pointer | Pointer warp | `warpcursor` | `river_seat_v1.pointer_warp` | `warp-pointer` | X | Triad exposes explicit IPC. |
| Input | Keyboard repeat | `repeat_rate`, `repeat_delay` | `river_input_device_v1.set_repeat_info` | `input.keyboard.repeat-rate`, `input.keyboard.repeat-delay` | X | Applied to keyboard devices when the River input management protocol is available. |
| Input | XKB rules/layout/options | `xkb_rules_*` | `river_xkb_config_v1` | `input.keyboard.xkb` | X | Triad builds keymaps with libxkbcommon; binds can still set per-binding layout override. |
| Input | Keyboard layout switch | `switch_keyboard_layout` | `set_layout_by_index/name` | `switch-keyboard-layout`, `bind ... layout=<index>` | X | Triad binds may override layout, and native `switch-keyboard-layout` plus Niri-compatible `SwitchLayout` cycle configured `input.keyboard.xkb.layout` entries through River XKB config. |
| Input | NumLock/CapsLock | `numlockon` | `numlock_enable`, `capslock_enable` | `input.keyboard.numlock`, `input.keyboard.capslock` | X | Applies requested initial lock state through River XKB config. |
| Input | Pointer acceleration | `mouse_accel_*`, `trackpad_accel_*` | `set_accel_profile`, `set_accel_speed` | `input.mouse/touchpad/trackpoint/trackball.accel-profile`, `accel-speed` | X | Applies only when the device reports matching libinput support. |
| Input | Natural scroll | `mouse_natural_scrolling`, `trackpad_natural_scrolling` | `set_natural_scroll` | `input.*.natural-scroll` | X | Supported for mouse, touchpad, trackpoint, and trackball sections. |
| Input | Tap/click/drag settings | `tap_to_click`, `click_method`, `tap_and_drag`, `drag_lock` | libinput config requests | `input.touchpad.tap`, `click-method`, `drag`, `drag-lock` | X | Touchpad-only settings are gated by libinput capability reports. |
| Input | Left-handed/middle emulation | `left_handed`, `middle_button_emulation` | libinput config requests | `input.*.left-handed`, `input.*.middle-emulation` | X | Supported for pointer class sections. |
| Input | Scroll factor/button/method | `axis_scroll_factor`, `scroll_button`, `scroll_method` | input/libinput config requests | `input.*.scroll-factor`, `scroll-button`, `scroll-method` | X | Scroll method/button uses libinput config; scroll factor uses River input device config. |
| Output | Monitor rules | `monitorrule` | `zwlr_output_manager_v1` | `output { layout ...; monitor "name" { mode; scale; position; transform; adaptive-sync; vrr; enabled; disabled; reserved_area } }` | X | Triad applies physical matrix layout, advertised and custom output modes, auto placement, scale/transform/adaptive-sync, output enablement, and additive reserved-area insets at startup and config reload. River-blocked mirror/color/HDR/ICC fields remain strict validation errors. Legacy top-level output rules remain supported. |
| Output | Monitor power | `disable_monitor`, `enable_monitor`, `toggle_monitor` | External output management | `output "name" { enabled; disabled }`, `power-off-monitors`, `power-on-monitors`, `power-off-monitor <output>`, `power-on-monitor <output>` | X | Declarative config can enable or disable outputs. Runtime monitor power commands disable all currently enabled outputs, or one targeted output such as `DP-3`, and restore that saved set without mutating output config rules. |
| Output | Presentation/tearing | `allow_tearing`, `force_tearing`, `vrr` | `river_output_v1.set_presentation_mode` | `presentation-mode` | X | Triad supports global vsync/async presentation mode. |
| Output | Cursor theme/size/find | | `river_seat_v1.set_xcursor_theme` | `cursor { theme; size; shake-to-find }` | X | Applied through River seat protocol. Shake-to-find temporarily reapplies the configured theme at a larger size. |
| Output | Cursor inactivity hiding | `cursor_hide_timeout` | `wl_pointer.set_cursor`, `wp_cursor_shape_manager_v1`, River seat cursor ownership | `cursor { hide-after-inactive-ms; hide-when-typing }` | X | Triad hides the compositor cursor with a null pointer cursor and restores the default cursor shape when cursor-shape support is advertised. |
| Tags | View tag/workspace | `view`, `viewtoleft`, `viewtoright` | WM policy | `focus-tag`, `focus-tag-left/right`, `focus-workspace` | X | Triad has tags plus derived workspace navigation. |
| Tags | Create workspace | | WM policy | `new-workspace` | X | Reuses an inactive empty dynamic workspace on the currently focused output when available; otherwise creates the next dynamic workspace after the reserved/configured workspace range and focuses it. Empty dynamic workspaces are pruned after leaving them. |
| Tags | View occupied tag | `viewtoleft_have_client`, `viewtoright_have_client` | WM policy | `focus-occupied-tag-left/right` | X | Triad skips empty tags. |
| Tags | Move window to tag | `tag`, `tagtoleft`, `tagtoright` | WM policy | `move-to-tag`, `move-to-tag-left/right` | X | Triad follows the moved window and also has `move-to-workspace`. |
| Tags | Toggle/multi-tag view | `toggletag`, `toggleview`, `comboview` | WM policy | | | Triad uses canonical tag masks internally but exposes single-target commands. |
| Tags | Rename tags | | WM policy | `rename-tag`, `workspace-rules { workspace ... name=... }` | X | Runtime commands use tags; config uses workspace language. |
| Tags | Tag rules | `tagrule` | WM policy | `workspace-rules { workspace ... }` | X | Triad supports workspace name and default layout rules backed by internal tags. Configured workspaces remain visible and stable even when their IDs exceed `workspaces.default-count`. |
| Monitor focus | Focus monitor | `focusmon` | WM policy | `focus-output` | X | Accepts connector/identity targets plus `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `next`, and `previous`. |
| Monitor focus | Move workspace to monitor | `tagmon`, `toggletagmon` | WM policy | `move-workspace-to-output` | X | Moves the active workspace without swapping. If the source monitor would be left without a visible workspace, Triad assigns it another workspace. Workspaces keep output affinity and restore to reconnected outputs. |
| Monitor focus | Move window to monitor | `tagmon`, `tagcrossmon`, `viewcrossmon` | WM policy | `move-to-output` | X | Moves the focused window to the workspace currently visible on the target output. |
| Focus | Directional focus | `focusdir` | `river_seat_v1.focus_window` primitive | `focus-left/right/up/down` | X | Triad maps to model focus commands. |
| Focus | Stack/next/previous focus | `focusstack` | WM policy | `focus-next`, `focus-prev` | X | |
| Focus | Last focus | `focuslast` | WM policy | `focus-last` | X | |
| Focus | Column boundary focus | | WM policy | `focus-column-first/last` | X | Triad-specific column navigation. |
| Focus | Focus by window id | | WM policy | `focus-window <id>` | X | Used by shell/overview. |
| Focus | Focus shell UI | | `river_seat_v1.focus_shell_surface` | `focus-shell-ui` | X | Triad shell integration. |
| Window lifecycle | Close focused window | `killclient` | `river_window_v1.close` | `close-window` | X | Optional id argument is supported. |
| Window lifecycle | Minimize | | minimize request/capability | `minimize`, `minimize-window` | X | Client-visible minimize state. Mango's `minimized` dispatcher is mapped under standard scratchpad because it sends windows to the scratchpad pool. |
| Window state | Toggle floating | `togglefloating` | `set_tiled` primitive | `toggle-floating` | X | |
| Window state | Toggle all floating | `toggle_all_floating` | WM policy | | | Not exposed by Triad. |
| Window state | Fullscreen | `togglefullscreen` | fullscreen requests and commands | `fullscreen-window`, `toggle-fullscreen`, `exit-fullscreen` | X | Optional id argument is supported. |
| Window state | Fake fullscreen | `togglefakefullscreen` | WM policy | | | No Triad equivalent. |
| Window state | Maximize column | `set_proportion 1.0` | WM policy | `maximize-column` | X | Full-width column; does not set client maximized state. |
| Window state | Maximize to edges | `togglemaximizescreen` | maximize request/capability | `maximize-window-to-edges`, `toggle-maximized`, `toggle-maximize` | X | Client-visible maximized state. |
| Window state | Sticky/global window | `toggleglobal`, `isglobal` | WM policy | `window-rule open-on-all-workspaces` | X | Exposed as declarative open policy. Triad does not yet expose an imperative toggle command. |
| Window state | Managed overlay | `toggleoverlay`, `isoverlay` | WM policy | `window-rule open-overlay` | X | Declarative managed stacking policy; not floating, sticky, or unmanaged. |
| Window state | Global unmanaged | `isunglobal` | Layer/shell primitives | `window-rule open-unmanaged-global` | X | Triad keeps the surface River-managed but gives it unmanaged-like global render and no workspace placement/focus/occupancy. |
| Window state | Center floating window | `centerwin`, `no_force_center` | WM policy | `window-rule center-floating`, `floating { x-ratio; y-ratio; ... }` | X | Rule-level centering controls generated floating geometry; Triad has no separate center command. |
| Window movement | Swap/move by direction | `exchange_client` | WM policy | `move-window-*`, `swap-window-up/down` | X | Directional movement mirrors directional focus and swaps with that target; empty frame targets receive the focused window. |
| Window movement | Stack exchange | `exchange_stack_client` | WM policy | `swap-window-up/down` | X | |
| Window movement | Move across workspace | | WM policy | `move-window-up/down-or-to-workspace-*` | X | Triad-specific command pair. |
| Window movement | Pointer move/resize | `smartmovewin`, `smartresizewin`, `movewin`, `resizewin` | pointer ops and resize primitives | `move-floating`, `resize-floating`, `pointer-bind ... move/resize` | X | Pointer bindings support floating windows and tiled drag/resize for built-in/native layouts. |
| Window grouping | Consume/expel/group | `scroller_stack` | WM policy | `consume-window`, `expel-window`, `group-windows`, `ungroup-window`, `focus-next-in-group` | X | Triad groups the focused window with the next rendered neighbor in scroller and frame-tree layouts; BSP ignores grouping to avoid hidden tree leaves. |
| Layouts | Set layout | `setlayout` | WM policy | short layout IDs, `layout-*`, `layout-custom`, native `set-layout`, native action parity | X | Triad supports scroller, bundled Janet layouts, native layouts, and declared user Janet layouts. Built-in, bundled, and native layout IDs can be used directly in binds, e.g. `notion`, `dwindle`, `spiral`, and `i3`. |
| Layouts | Cycle layout | `switch_layout`, `circle_layout` | WM policy | `switch-layout`, `layout-cycle` | X | Triad config controls the cycle order, including bundled and declared Janet layouts. |
| Layouts | Layout defaults per workspace | `tagrule layout_name` | WM policy | `workspaces default-layout`, `workspace-rules default-layout=...` | X | Built-in ids, bundled Janet ids, native ids, and declared Janet layout names are accepted. |
| Layouts | Master count | `incnmaster`, `default_nmaster`, `nmaster` | WM policy | `master-count`, `adjust-master-count`, `layout.master.count` | X | |
| Layouts | Master ratio | `setmfact`, `default_mfact`, `mfact` | WM policy | `master-ratio`, `adjust-master-ratio`, `layout.master.split-ratio` | X | |
| Layouts | Scroller width/proportion | `set_proportion`, `scroller_default_proportion` | WM policy | `set-column-width`, `resize-width`, `default-column-width`, `scroller-proportion`, `scroller-single-proportion` | X | Triad uses column/window width proportions; scroller rule proportions apply at new-window placement time. |
| Layouts | Scroller focus centering | `scroller_focus_center`, `scroller_prefer_center` | WM policy | `scroller-focus-center`, `scroller-prefer-center` | X | |
| Layouts | Proportion presets | `scroller_proportion_preset`, `switch_proportion_preset` | WM policy | `scroller-proportion-presets`, `switch-proportion-preset` | X | Triad cycles focused horizontal or vertical scroller columns through configured clamped presets. |
| Layouts | TGMix layout | `tgmix` | WM policy | `layout-tgmix`, `tgmix` layout id | X | Uses tile for up to three windows, grid after that. |
| Layouts | Spiral layout | spiral | WM policy | `layout-spiral`, `spiral` layout id, `layout.spiral` | X | Bundled Janet qtile-style recursive split layout with configurable ratio, main pane, and direction. |
| Layouts | Gaps | `incgaps`, `togglegaps`, `smartgaps` | WM policy | `adjust-gaps`, `toggle-gaps`, `smart-gaps`, `gaps` | X | Native `frame-tree` uses gaps between split frames and fills the output usable rect without an outer frame-tree margin. Native `bsp-tree` and `i3` apply normal outer and inner gaps. |
| Layouts | Border style | `toggle_render_border`, `no_render_border` | `river_window_v1.set_borders` | `border { width; active-color; inactive-color }` | X | Triad has border config, not a runtime toggle. |
| Layouts | Frame and i3 tab colors | | protocol decoration surfaces | `frame-tabs { active-color; active-unfocused-color; inactive-color; active-line-color; active-unfocused-line-color; empty-background-color }` | X | Native frame-tree/notion tabs and i3 tabbed/stacking containers share configurable tab colors with current hard-coded values as defaults; empty frames use the configurable background plus native border chrome from the same frame geometry substrate. |
| Layouts | Layout switch toast | | WM policy | `layout-switch-toast { enabled; timeout-ms; ring-color }` | X | Native centered toast shown after active-workspace layout commands; follows command bindings rather than a hard-coded key. |
| Overview | Toggle overview | `toggleoverview` | WM policy | `toggle-overview`, `open-overview`, `close-overview` | X | |
| Overview | Overview layout gaps and zoom | `overviewgappi`, `overviewgappo` | WM policy | `overview { inner-gap-multiplier; outer-gap; zoom }` | X | All layouts use the unified workspace-preview overview with Niri-style workspace navigation/camera behavior. See [Niri overview compatibility](./niri-overview-comp.md). |
| Overview | Scroller overflow indicators | | WM policy | `overview { scroller-indicators }` | X | Off by default. When enabled, scroller previews render subtle edge hints if hidden columns extend beyond the preview frame. |
| Overview | Hot corner overview | `enable_hotarea`, `hotarea_size`, `hotarea_corner` | WM policy | `overview { hot-corners { size; top-left; top-right; bottom-left; bottom-right } }` | X | Triad hot corners are opt-in and open overview only. |
| Overview | Overview tab mode | `ov_tab_mode` | WM policy | `overview { tab-mode }` | X | Off by default. Keyboard overview opener bindings with modifiers become hold-to-overview sessions: repeat the opener to cycle windows, release the opener modifier to close overview. |
| Scratchpad | Standard scratchpad | `minimized`, `toggle_scratchpad`, `restore_minimized` | WM policy | `move-to-scratchpad`, `toggle-scratchpad`, `restore-scratchpad` | X | Default chords use one scratchpad family: `Super+s` sends the focused window, `Super+Alt+s` toggles/cycles standard scratchpad windows, and `Super+Shift+s` restores the window to its previous workspace. In i3 layout scope, `Super+s` remains stacking and `Super+Ctrl+s` sends to scratchpad. |
| Scratchpad | Named scratchpad | `toggle_named_scratchpad`, `isnamedscratchpad` | WM policy | `move-to-named-scratchpad`, `toggle-named-scratchpad` | X | Triad names scratchpads directly. |
| Scratchpad | Scratchpad size | `scratchpad_width_ratio`, `scratchpad_height_ratio` | WM policy | `scratchpad { width-ratio; height-ratio }` | X | |
| Window rules | App/title matching | `windowrule appid/title` | Window metadata events | `window-rule { match app-id=... title=...; exclude ... }` | X | Match and exclude use regex search semantics; repeated `match` children are OR-ed. |
| Window rules | State matching | `windowrule isfloating`, focus/window-state variants | WM policy | `match is-focused=... is-active=... is-active-in-column=... is-floating=...` | X | Opening-time evaluation uses unmapped defaults; existing-window dynamic fields refresh from current runtime state. |
| Window rules | Default workspace | `windowrule tags` | WM policy | `window-rule default-workspace`, `default-workspaces` | X | `default-workspaces` places a matching window on multiple Triad workspace tags; the first target is the primary focus/snapshot target. |
| Window rules | Sticky/global workspace placement | `windowrule global`, global tags | WM policy | `window-rule open-on-all-workspaces` | X | Matching top-level windows are synced to every materialized workspace. Sticky-only occupancy does not keep dynamic workspaces alive, and scratchpad clears sticky state. |
| Window rules | Open floating | `windowrule isfloating` | WM policy | `window-rule open-floating` | X | Explicit `#false` can override parented dialog floating defaults. |
| Window rules | Open focused | `windowrule isopensilent` | WM policy | `window-rule open-focused` | X | Triad uses positive Niri-style naming for Mango's open-silent escape hatch. |
| Window rules | Open fullscreen/maximized | `isfullscreen`, `isfakefullscreen`, `noopenmaximized` | WM policy | `open-fullscreen`, `open-maximized`, `open-maximized-to-edges` | X | `open-maximized` means full-width scroller column; `open-maximized-to-edges` means client-visible maximize. |
| Window rules | Maximize action policy | `force_fakemaximize`, `ignore_maximize` | WM policy | `maximize-policy` | X | `edge` keeps client-visible maximize, `column` maps maximize actions to full-width scroller columns, and `ignore` refuses maximize-on actions. |
| Window rules | Open sizing/output | `width`, `height`, `monitor`, `scroller_proportion`, `scroller_proportion_single` | WM policy | `open-on-output`, `default-column-width`, `scroller-proportion`, `scroller-single-proportion`, `default-window-width`, `default-window-height` | X | `open-on-output` targets a visible output workspace by connector, shell fallback, make/model identity, or description, and with `default-workspace` may silently map a non-primary output to that workspace. `scroller-proportion` overrides `default-column-width` for new scroller columns; `scroller-single-proportion` centers a single scroller column only. |
| Window rules | Open named scratchpad | `isnamedscratchpad`, `single_scratchpad` | WM policy | `open-named-scratchpad`, `toggle-named-scratchpad` | X | New matching windows open hidden and untagged until toggled; live restore wins over the rule. |
| Window rules | Size bounds | `width`, `height`, `isnosizehint` | size-hint policy | `min-width`, `min-height`, `max-width`, `max-height`, `respect-size-hints` | X | Rule bounds constrain geometry without changing placement; `respect-size-hints #false` ignores client hints while keeping explicit Triad bounds. |
| Window rules | Parented float role | `isfloating`, `isoverlay`, app rules | WM policy | `window-rule parented-role` | X | `dialog`, `tool`, and `plain` separate transient dialogs from persistent parented floats without using overlay/global state. |
| Window rules | Dialog viewport jump | Window rule/policy-specific | WM policy | `window-rule dialog-viewport-jump` | X | Matches the parent app rule; opts specific apps out of hide-until-visible dialog focus. |
| Window rules | Forced layout | `windowrule scroller_proportion...` and layout rules | WM policy | `window-rule forced-layout` | X | Triad supports forced layout selection, not every Mango per-window layout parameter. |

  size fields, and `default-floating-position`.
- `environment`, `spawn-at-startup`, `window-menu-command`.
- `bindings`: `mirror-hjkl-arrows`, `bind`, `pointer-bind`, `axis-bind`,
  `gesture-bind`, layout-scoped `layout "<id>" { bind ... }` blocks, plus
  `layout`, `mode`, `allow-inhibiting`,
  `on-release`, `while-locked`, `hotkey-overlay-title`, and gesture `fingers`
  properties.
- `switch-events`: `lid-close`, `lid-open`, `tablet-mode-on`,
  `tablet-mode-off`.
- `shells`: `enabled`, `active`, `cycle`, `watchdog`, `fallback`,
  `exclusive-focus-timeout-ms`, `profile`, `launch`, `stop`, `niri-compat`.
- `janet`: `enabled`, `automation-dir`, `layout-dir`, `fuel-limit`,
  `layout <name> fallback=<scroller|vertical-scroller|frame-tree|bsp-tree|i3>`;
  legacy `script-dir` is accepted as an `automation-dir` alias. User layout
  names must not collide with bundled Janet layout ids such as `notion`, `bsp`,
  `dwindle`, and `spiral`. Algorithmic fallback ids are compatibility aliases that
  normalize to `scroller`.
  Scripts receive `triad/snapshot`, `triad/current-window`, and
  `triad/current-event`; they can subscribe with `triad/on` and emit every
  registered user command through `triad/command`. Declared Janet layouts can
  participate in `layout-cycle`, workspace defaults, `layout-custom`, native
  `set-layout`, and `set-layout-for-workspace`. Core movement mirrors
  directional focus; Janet layouts may register a narrow advanced override hook
  for `move-window-*` commands. Native layouts can be selected
  with `layout-native <name>`; `frame-tree`, `bsp-tree`, and `i3` are
  native layout ids.
  `frame-tree` supports `frame-split-horizontal`, `frame-split-vertical`, `frame-unsplit`,
  `frame-tab-next`, and `frame-tab-prev`. Frame splits move the active tab to
  the new sibling only when the focused frame has multiple tabs; one-tab frames
  create an empty sibling and keep focus on the original frame; already-empty
  frames do not split. Use `frame-unsplit` to remove the focused empty frame. Default
  configs bind frame tab cycling to `Super+Page_Up` and `Super+Page_Down`.
  Frame-tree geometry fills the output usable rect, uses layout gaps only
  between split frames, and retains empty frame rects for native chrome.
  Layout-scoped bindings can expose frame commands only while a frame layout is
  active; default configs use `layout "notion"` with `Super+Alt+h/v/x` for split
  horizontal, split vertical, and unsplit.
- `nimble doctorLive` builds the current native CLI and validates the live
  session after pulls before `nimble liveReload` installs binaries. It syncs
  packaged session scripts, checks the installed live binary for native session
  support, requires current supervisor metadata and daemon executable identity,
  validates config and declared Janet layout assets, and reports exact repair
  commands without editing user config.
  `i3` supports `split-tree-split-horizontal`,
  `split-tree-split-vertical`, `split-tree-split-toggle`,
  `split-tree-layout-split-horizontal`, `split-tree-layout-split-vertical`,
  `split-tree-layout-toggle-split`, `split-tree-layout-stacking`, and
  `split-tree-layout-tabbed`; focus, `move-window-*`, and
  `resize-width`/`resize-height` operate on the native split container tree.
  Existing `frame-tab-next` and `frame-tab-prev` bindings cycle the focused
  i3 tabbed or stacking container.
  Default configs scope i3 keys to `layout "i3"` so `Super+Alt+h/v` split the
  focused container and `Super+e/s/w` select split, stacking, and tabbed modes
  without stealing those keys from other layouts.
  See `docs/comp/i3-layout-conformance.md` for a full per-behavior conformance
  audit against upstream i3 and a prioritized gap-remediation list.
  See `docs/comp/notion-layout-conformance.md` for a conformance audit of
  `frame-tree`/`notion` against notion-river and the original notion WM.
- `layout.frame-tabs`: `active-color`, `active-unfocused-color`,
  `inactive-color`, `active-line-color`, `active-unfocused-line-color`,
  `empty-background-color`.
- `terminal`: `command`.

  `scroller-indicators`, `hot-corners`.
- `recent-windows`: `off`, `debounce-ms`, `open-delay-ms`, `highlight`,
  `previews`, `binds`.
- `hotkey-overlay`: `skip-at-startup`, `hide-not-bound`, `position`, and
  `columns`; generated default configs show the centered helper at startup,
  while omitted fields keep `skip-at-startup` on and `position` top. While open
  it captures the next non-modifier key and dismisses without running bound
  commands.
- `config-notification`: `reload-succeeded`, `reload-failed`,
  `reload-rolled-back`.

  commands navigate between frames; explicit `frame-tab-next` and
  `frame-tab-prev` commands cycle frame tabs and native i3 tabbed or stacking
  containers.

Native JSON IPC requests:

- `state`
- `capabilities`
- `captures`
- `commands` (`triad msg commands --json` prints the same catalog locally)
- `layout-state` (`triad msg layout-state` prints this reply)
- `set-layout`
- `switch-layout` (`triad msg switch-layout` prints the ack)
- `event-stream`
- `dispatch-binding`

CLI and environment:

- `TRIAD_CONFIG`, `triad --config <path>`, and `triad -c <path>` select a
  non-default root config path.
- `triad validate-config [--config <path>]` checks config syntax, includes,
  strict window-rule regex validation, and configured Janet script/layout
  registration without starting the daemon.
- `triad --dev-mode` and `TRIAD_DEV_MODE=1` enable developer-session defaults
  such as behavior JSONL logs. `TRIAD_BEHAVIOR_LOG=0` still forces those logs
  off, and `TRIAD_BEHAVIOR_LOG=1` enables them without the full dev mode.
- `triad session`, `triad supervise`, `triad doctor-live`, `triad live-reload`,
  and `triad logs [--json]` own the live session entrypoint, daemon supervision,
  live-session preflight, manager replacement, and log discovery.
- `nimble liveReload` builds release binaries, then delegates to
  `triad live-reload`, which starts the replacement daemon in dev mode through a
  one-shot runtime marker. Native supervised sessions are detected through
  `current-session.json`; older shell-managed sessions must restart once before
  live reload continues. Direct `triad-reload` preserves dev mode only when the
  active daemon was already in dev mode.
- `triad msg dev-mode [on|off|toggle|status]` changes or reports the live
  daemon diagnostics mode without restarting the session.
- `triad msg state`, `triad msg capabilities`, `triad msg captures`, and `triad msg layout-state`
  print native Triad JSON snapshots for development and shell integrations.
- `triad msg request <json>` sends one raw native or compatibility IPC request
  and prints the reply.
- `triad_niri msg --json event-stream` prints the long-lived Niri-compatible
  event stream, including the initial workspace snapshot used by plug-and-play
  bars.
- `triad msg dispatch-binding key|pointer|axis|gesture <chord> [ticks|fingers]`
  dispatches configured bindings without raw input injection.
- `triad msg perf-status` reports frame pacing, idle wake timing, wait backend,
  render-start skip paths, layout-projection runs, loop wake counters, recent
  message/effect/event counts, IPC broadcast byte counters, subscriber scope
  counts, and render/manage counters for live CPU investigations.
- `triad msg mem-status` reports process memory, Nim heap counters, model and
  daemon object counts, protocol-surface buffer estimates, Janet script/cache
  counters, shell state, and IPC subscriber scope counts for live memory
  investigations.
